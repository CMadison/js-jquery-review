#JavaScript and jQuery Review

Let's review JavaScript and jQuery.

##Getting Started

* Fork and clone this repository
* Run `npm install` to install dependencies
  * `npm start` - start the BrowserSync server
  * `npm run lint:css` - lint CSS
  * `npm run lint:js` - lint JS

##Requirements

1. Inside the `/js/getting-functional` directory, go through each file and write a solution for each problem. Use `node` to run the file and test your functions.

2. Open `index.html` by running `npm start`. This file links to four different exercises that require the use of jQuery. Complete each one by editing the files in `/js/using-jquery`

  * Each of the HTML files contains instructions.
  * All problems can be solved by editing the `.js` files in the `/js/using-jquery` folder.
  * You do not need to edit the stylesheets or HTML to solve any of these problems, but if you want to get creative after you solve the original problems, feel free. However, be aware that all pages use the same CSS, so any modifications will be reflected on all pages and could have unforeseen consequences.
  * When in doubt use the [jQuery Documentation](http://api.jquery.com/).
